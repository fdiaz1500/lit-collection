That does not mean that one cannot learn how to be more productive while working from their bedroom or home office. Apart from the obvious benefits of flexible work time, living closer to your family and more personal time saved everyday by avoiding daily commute to work, remote work environment teaches you a lot of valuable skills in life like being a good communicator, being better organized and becoming more responsible, among other things.</p><h3>Is it possible to get more accomplished in less time?</h3><p>You would think that the more time you spend working, the more results you produce. It sounds like common sense, doesn’t it? Well, have you ever accomplished more work when you are in a hurry? I have too. That’s Parkinson’s law in action: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion".</p><p>Peter Thiel once asked, “How can you achieve your 10 year plan in the next 6 months?” If you are smart enough, you can accomplish more in less time.</p><h2>What to do when you don’t feel like working?</h2><p>Have you had unproductive days where you just felt like watching a bunch of movies on NetFlix back to back or playing your favorite computer game, even though you know that there’s work to be done? That happens to everyone. It starts off as a bad day and before you know it, you not only fall back on your todo list, but also start to feel guilty for not getting any work done.</p><p>The best thing to do in that situation is to accept the fact that you are not feeling in the zone. But the solution is not to give in into that feeling and start binge watching NetFlix either. You can do one of two things in that situation.</p><ol><li>Start working on your most favorite thing on the project. It can be the least priority task in that project. So, instead of working on that advanced role-based permission system that you’ve been working on for the past week, you can start tweaking the button color and font-size on the user signup form. That is going to give you some dopamine hits in the form of small wins and can eventually motivate you to get back on track. This way, you are accomplishing some kind of work without wasting your time and your team is going to be happy with the new update you made on the signup form, which can in-turn increase more customer signup.</li><li>Refactor your code. Pick up any piece of code that you’ve told yourself many times that it has to be refactored, and start making it better and shorter. Every software codebase needs to be refactored once in a while. Refactoring usually is not going to be as tasking as working on a new feature so it’s a much easier way of getting yourself into the zone.</li></ol><h2>How to not get overwhelmed by client deadlines?</h2><p>Working in a remote startup can be really tasking when you reach near the deadline for your project. I’ve been there; and all software teams go through it at some point. The goal is to break down the project or feature into small digestible tasks and working on those tasks one by one. It’s very easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of work to be done overall. But engineering is all about breaking it down into small actionable pieces and focusing on them instead.</p><p>For example, let’s say that you are working on the backend of a user and authentication module as part of your CRM project. Before starting to work on that module (ideally when the day starts), break the module down into small actionable “tasks”, allot a timeline for each of those tasks and start working on them one by one.</p><b>Task Breakdown table</b><table><tr><th>Tasks</th><th>Timeline</th><th>Done?</th></tr><tr><td>Finalize the columns of the Users table</td><td>9:00 AM - 9:30 AM</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Design the Users table model in the ORM</td><td>9:30 AM - 10:00 AM</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Define the REST API schema for CRUD operations</td><td>10:00 AM - 11:00 AM</td><td>In-progress</td></tr><tr><td>-- BREAK --</td><td>11:00 AM - 11:30 AM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Implement the create user API (Registration)</td><td>11:30 AM - 12:45 PM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>-- LUNCH BREAK --</td><td>12:45 PM - 2:00 PM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Implement the get user/users API</td><td>2:00 PM - 2:20 PM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Implement the Login API and session management</td><td>2:20 PM - 3:30 PM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>-- BREAK --</td><td>3:30 PM - 4:00 PM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Implement the update user (profile) API</td><td>4:00 PM - 4:45 PM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Implement the delete user API</td><td>4:45 PM - 5:00 PM</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Implement validations for create and update APIs</td><td>5:00 PM - 6:00 PM</td><td>-</td></tr></table><p>Now, don’t worry if you are not able to complete the tasks by the timeline you’ve set. The goal of the timeline is not to finish it on time, but to push you to focus on completing the tasks instead of looking out the window or starting to check your Instagram. You can simply move those tasks down to the evenings or even include them in the next day’s agenda.</p><p>When you start your day by breaking down your tasks like this and start focusing on completing them one by one, you shift your focus from the worry of the upcoming deadline and start enjoying the work like when you wrote your first programs to generate a pyramid of numbers. The ability to separate concerns like this goes a long way in making you a better developer/engineer.</p><h2>Change your work setup and environment</h2><p>If you don’t feel excited to get started with your work, your work environment probably plays a huge role in making you feel that way. Keep your desk clean and away from distractions. It is also the small things like the lightings and your chair and the table. That is why funded startups and companies spend millions of dollars in a really good office environment. But feel free to move around with your laptop and be a domestic nomad if you feel like it.</p><p>Some of the things you’ll need in your work room are as follows:</p><ol><li>Have a notebook and a pen to jot down notes from the daily team calls, and to scribble ideas.</li><li>Buy a whiteboard and write the goals for the day on it, for instance.</li><li>Have a good pair of headphones and a webcam for your team calls.</li><li>Some fruits or healthy drinks.</li><li>A snow-white owl to bring you your posts (just kidding).</li></ol><p>It’s also very easy to get distracted with home activities or to get interrupted by family members (like your mom, wife or your son) when you work from home. Telling your family members that you are working and not to disturb you goes a long way. You can attend to those activities during the “BREAK” time you have planned in your task breakdown table above.</p><p>And most importantly, turn off your WhatsApp and Instagram notifications on your phone.</p><p>Did you find this post informative?
